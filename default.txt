	sudo mysql_secure_installation         (select y for every query)

	*** While running the security script, you provided a password for root. This user, however, is not allowed to connect to the MySQL shell using the same password. You can change configure root to use the MySQL shell by changing its authentication method from the default “auth_socket” to “mysql_native_password”.

	sudo mysql
	SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;

	*** In the above output, you can see that root is using the auth-socket plugin for authentication by default.

	ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'This%%is%%my%%pass%%for%%mysql%%022';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
	exit
